# NERSC Ensemble Data Assimilation System (NEDAS)

initiated by Yue Ying 2022

A unitified ensemble data assimilation scripts/code for NERSC models: HYCOM, neXtSIM, WRF, ECOSMO, NorCPM (potentially). Features: common analysis grid; multiscale (localization, inflation, alignment) DA algorithms; modularized design.

# Components:

## Grid interpolation


## Ensemble perturbation


## Data assimilation algorithms
